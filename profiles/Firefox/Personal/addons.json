Here is a quick video showing you how it works.\n\nUnder the hood, it separates website storage into tab-specific Containers. Cookies downloaded by one Container are not available to other Containers. You can even integrate individual Containers with Mozilla VPN to protect your browsing and location. With the Firefox Multi-Account Containers extension, you can...\n\n    Sign in to two different accounts on the same site (for example, you could sign in to work email and home email in two different Container tabs.\n    Keep different kinds of browsing far away from each other (for example, you might use one Container tab for managing your Checking Account and a different Container tab for searching for new songs by your favorite band)\n    Avoid leaving social-network footprints all over the web (for example, you could use a Container tab for signing in to a social network, and use a different tab for visiting online news sites, keeping your social identity separate from tracking scripts on news sites)\n    Protect your browsing activity in individual Containers using Mozilla VPN, so you can shop while travelling abroad but check your bank account from a server in your home country.\n\n\nAfter installing the Firefox Multi-Account Containers extension, click the Containers icon to edit your Containers. Change their colors, names, and icons. Long-click the new tab button to open a new Container tab.\n\nFor more information on how to use Multi-Account Containers, visit our help articles:\n\n\nAll about Multi Account Containers\nMulti Container user - how to use Mozilla VPN\nVPN subscriber - how to use Multi Account Containers","weeklyDownloads":10662,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"Mozilla Firefox","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/4757633/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/266/266157.png?modified=1643906676","width":1440,"height":816,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/266/266157.jpg?modified=1643906676","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":302},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/266/266158.png?modified=1643906676","width":1440,"height":816,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/266/266158.jpg?modified=1643906676","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":302},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/266/266160.png?modified=1643906676","width":1440,"height":816,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/266/266160.jpg?modified=1643906676","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":302},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/266/266159.png?modified=1643906676","width":1440,"height":816,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/266/266159.jpg?modified=1643906676","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":302}],"contributionURL":"","averageRating":4.6212,"reviewCount":2912,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/multi-account-containers/reviews/","updateDate":1650623375000},{"id":"{d3e01ff2-9a3a-4007-8f6e-7acd9a5de263}","icons":{"32":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/323/323580-32.png?modified=cbffaf98","64":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/323/323580-64.png?modified=cbffaf98","128":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/323/323580-128.png?modified=cbffaf98"},"name":"SAML-tracer","version":"1.7.1","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/3884953/saml_tracer-1.7.1.xpi","homepageURL":"https://github.com/SimpleSAMLphp/SAML-tracer/","supportURL":null,"description":"A tool for viewing SAML and WS-Federation messages sent through the browser during single sign-on and single logout.","fullDescription":"A tool for viewing SAML and WS-Federation messages sent through the browser during single sign-on and single logout.","weeklyDownloads":647,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"Jaime Perez","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/12105918/"},"developers":[{"name":"Thijs Kinkhorst","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/17147476/"},{"name":"Jan Köhler","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/13723895/"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/198/198569.png?modified=1622132558","width":830,"height":704,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/198/198569.jpg?modified=1622132558","thumbnailWidth":472,"thumbnailHeight":400,"caption":"Viewing a SAML 2.0 Response in SAML-tracer."}],"contributionURL":"","averageRating":4.1489,"reviewCount":26,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/saml-tracer/reviews/","updateDate":1640155569000}]}
